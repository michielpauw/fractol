# Fractol

In this project I create all sorts of fractals. The main challenge I encountered was the optimization of the zooming into the fractal. I now make initial calculations for bigger squares first, reducing the amount of calculations necessary when zooming in. When the zooming stops, I render all intermediate pixels. When zooming with the mouse wheel, the zoom follows the position of the mouse exactly. This makes the experience quite nice.

## Different fractals
### Mandelbrot
The fractal created by the Mandelbrot set is the best known fractal in the world. The Mandelbrot set consists of all complex numbers _c_ for which the function _f<sub>c</sub> = z<sup>2</sup> - c_ does not diverge. This set is completely black in the fractal. The colors signify the rate at which the numbers that are not in the set diverge.
